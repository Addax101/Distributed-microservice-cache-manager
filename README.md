# Distributed Microservice Cache Manager

The Distributed Microservice Cache Manager is a microservice that provides a centralized cache management system that can be used by other microservices to store and retrieve frequently used data. It uses caching technologies like Redis, Memcached, or Hazelcast to cache data, and is built using a REST API that allows other microservices to access it.
